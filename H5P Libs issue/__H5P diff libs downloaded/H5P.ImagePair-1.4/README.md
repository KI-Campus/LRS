# H5P-Image-Pair

A free HTML5-based image pairing activity that allows authors to create pairs of images to be matched. Learners are presented with the unpaired images and have to either use drag and drop or click on the images they think matches. Since it is not required for both images in a pair to be the same, authors are also able to test the understanding of a relation between two different images. Image pairing is available through the H5P plugin on Drupal, Moodle or Wordpress sites and is embeddable onto any website that allows embeds.
[See it in action on h5p.org](https://h5p.org/image-pairing)
